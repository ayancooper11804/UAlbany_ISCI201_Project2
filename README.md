This program reads from the text file Roster.txt, a file that contains a list of students with their GPAs. The class 
DriverGPA works with the class Student to allow users to read and choose from a menu of options. These options consist of 
finding the student with the lowest GPA, finding the student with the highest GPA, calculating the average GPA, displaying the 
entire roster, and quitting the program. The program will run over and over until the user chooses to quit the program.
